Two level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner with exotic (non-standard) coarse grid spaces This uses the <A HREF="../PC/PCMG.html#PCMG">PCMG</A> infrastructure restricted to two levels and the face and wirebasket based coarse
grid spaces. These coarse grid spaces originate in the work of Bramble, Pasciak  and Schatz, "The Construction
of Preconditioners for Elliptic Problems by Substructing IV", Mathematics of Computation, volume 53 pages 1--24, 1989.
They were generalized slightly in "Domain Decomposition Method for Linear Elasticity", Ph. D. thesis, Barry Smith,
New York University, 1990. They were then explored in great detail in Dryja, Smith, Widlund, "Schwarz Analysis
of Iterative Substructuring Methods for Elliptic Problems in Three Dimensions, SIAM Journal on Numerical
Analysis, volume 31. pages 1662-1694, 1994. These were developed in the context of iterative substructuring preconditioners.
They were then ingeniously applied as coarse grid spaces for overlapping Schwarz methods by Dohrmann and Widlund.
They refer to them as GDSW (generalized Dryja, Smith, Widlund preconditioners). See, for example,
