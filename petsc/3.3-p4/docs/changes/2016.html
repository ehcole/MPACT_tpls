        <h2>NEW FEATURES and <a name="CHANGES">CHANGES</a> in PETSc 2.0.16</h2>
      </div>

      <h4>General:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Added the option -compare option for incremental debugging; see the
          users manual for more details.
        </li>

        <li>
          Added tags file so that vi users can easily browse PETSc source files
          (just as emacs users already can by using etags). See the users
          manual subsection &quot;VI users&quot; for details.
        </li>

        <li>
          We have stopped distributing the UNIX-style manpages with PETSc.
          Instead, we now only distribute the HTML version. You can still
          access the man pages with the command $PETSC_DIR/bin/petscman.
          Alternatively, you can directly view $PETSC_DIR/docs/www/www.html.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>TS (Timestepping Solvers):</h4>
      <h4>SNES (Nonlinear Solvers):</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          You can now attach several SNES monitoring routines with
          SNESMonitorSet() instead of only one as previously allowed.
          Similarly, multiple monitors can be used from the options database
          (e.g., -snes_monitor and -snes_xmonitor).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>SLES (Linear Solvers):</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>See PC and KSP</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>KSP (Krylov Subspace Methods):</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          You can now attach several KSP monitoring routines with
          KSPSetMonitor() instead of only one as previously allowed. Similarly,
          multiple monitors can be used from the options database (e.g.,
          -ksp_monitor and -ksp_xmonitor).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>PC (Preconditioners):</h4>
      <h4>MAT (Matrices):</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Added the routines MatSetValuesLocal(), MatZeroRowsLocal() and
          MatSetLocalToGlobalMapping() to enable the user to set values in
          a matrix using a local numbering of the nodes rather than a global
          numbering.
        </li>

        <li>
          Added the option MAT_IGNORE_OFF_PROC_ENTRIES for MatSetOptions(),
          which causes all entries on any processor destined to be stored on
          a different processor to be dropped instead. This is useful if you
          know that the &quot;owning&quot; processor is also always generating
          the correct entries, so PETSc need not ship over the duplicate entry
          generated on another processor. -
        </li>

        <li>
          Added options MAT_COLUMNS_UNSORTED and MAT_ROWS_UNSORTED for
          MatSetOptions() to enable switching betwen sorted and unsorted input.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>DA (Distributed Arrays):</h4>
      <h4>VEC (Vectors):</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Changed the SCATTER_ALL argument in VecScatterXXX() routines to
          SCATTER_FORWARD.
        </li>

        <li>
          Added the routines VecSetValuesLocal() and
          VecSetLocalToGlobalMapping() to allow the user to set values into
          a vector using a local numbering of the nodes rather than a global
          numbering.
        </li>

        <li>
          Added the routine
          VecSetOption(Vec,VEC_IGNORE_OFF_PROCESSOR_ENTRIES,PETSC_TRUE), which
          causes all entries on any processor destined to be stored on
          a different processor to be dropped instead. This is useful if you
          know that the &quot;owning&quot; processor is also always generating
          the correct entries, so PETSc need not transfer the duplicate entries
          generated on another processor.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>IS (Index Sets):</h4>
      <h4>Draw (Graphics):</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>The numbers on the axis plots are much improved.</li>

        <li>
          You can now pass PETSC_DECIDE as the x and y arguments in DrawOpenX()
          and ViewerDrawOpenX() to let PETSc place non-overlapping windows on
          the display.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Viewers:</h4>
      <h4>System Routines:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Added routines PetscSynchronizedPrintf(MPI_Comm,format,args) and
          PetscSynchronizedFlush(MPI_Comm), which allow groups of processes to
          print to stdout as one would expect. I.e., the output from processor
          0 is followed by the output from processor 1, etc. Very useful during
          code development. This can often be a substitute for attempting to
          sequentialize printf() statements via PetscSequentialPhaseBegin()
          and PetscSequentialPhaseEnd(). -
        </li>

        <li>
          Added the command line option -options_file &lt;file&gt; that causes
          all options in the specified file to be treated as if they were typed
          on the command line.
        </li>

        <li>
          Added the option -log_trace [filename] (and the corresponding routine
          PLogTraceBegin()) that allows tracing of all PETSc calls; useful to
          see where a program is hanging without running in the debugger. Can
          be used in conjunction with the -log_info option.
        </li>

        <li>
          Added PetscRandomSetInterval() to enable the user to set an interval
          over which random numbers will be uniformly distributed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Event Logging:</h4>
      <h4>Fortran Interface:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Added the Fortran interface for VecDuplicateVecs(), VecDestroyVecs(),
          VecMAXPY(), VecMDot(), and VecMTDot().
        </li>
      </ul>
